# Sinalito App Version 1

This app is a platform that offers a sign language course. The goal here is to apply my skills in ReactJs and new knowledge.

Due the pandemic time we are living in 2020 and 2021, people is adviced to keep distance. So, to keep offering courses that preper new professional to work on attending deafs. I projected a platform to offer the sign language courses.

First the student should get in touch with the central that offer the course, and if approved the admin will register him in the platform where will be setted the proper course who is avalaible depend on some criteria.

The app will sum up the videos time watched and than set it to conclusion certificates.

- Sign in and Sign up area, or the user can access through google account.
- Course board: it's where is listed all courses available. Some courses will be able to access just if the user has finished the firts one.
- classes page: where is listed the classes for the course choosed
- Certifications page: it's a page to see the certificates the user has conquired.
- Certification modal: it's the certification which the user can save or print.
- Profile: it's the page where the user can choose the photo, fix or complete his name and some details of yours.

##### Things to do:
  - Create a chat to talk with teacher. Maybe a forum to ask question.
  - Create the admin side.

### The Stack

This app was built using the stacks using the moderm ECMAScript, the wild known as JavaScript

- ReactJs: a JavaScript library.
- Typescript: a JavaScript superset.
- SASS: a pre-processor for CSS.
- Redux: An API for state management.
- Firebase: a Google platform for backend side.

### Some Libraries and APIs

- React-Router-Dom: an interesting way of routing components in ReactJs.
- Unform: it's a perfomance-focused API for creating forms.
- React-Input-Mask: it's an easly way of adding masks to an input element.
- React-Modal: it's an easy way to build a modal for applications.


### Things I've learned while building this app
- SASS concept, I thought it amazing.
- How to make my the app avalaible in multiple languages. I think it's great no just to change between languages, but it's awesome to make easy the code maintanace.
- Lerned local variable (.env.local).
- How to create costum hookies  



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
